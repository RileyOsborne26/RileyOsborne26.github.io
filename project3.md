## Project description

This project was developed by Riley Osborne, Dian Gong, and Garrett Lewis. I came up with the concept and the workload was split mainly as follows: Garrett's primary responsibility was the project GUI, my primary responsibility was the backend logic and functionality, and Dian's primary responsibility was assisting us both and helping tie Garrett and I's work together for a functional finished product. 

Our finished product consists of an account management program designed to... FILL_IN

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python setup.py
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.

## 3. Additional Considerations

As previously stated, this was a team effort and the professor was thoroughly pleased with the finished product. Our finished work is now used by the professor as an example for future classes to view as a successful completion of the Object-Oriented Programming Team Project.
